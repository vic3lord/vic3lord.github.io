Creating and advocating for advanced methodologies together with developers to have common ground between SRE and devs 
to have great DevOps culture and to have them impact their daily work.
- CI/CD with progressive rollouts and canaries
- Feature flags and A/B testing
- GitOps
- Ownership of teams and on-call shifts (you build it, you run it)
- Postmortem framework with emphasis on being blameless in order to learn and set up prevention for the future
- ChatOps and chatbots that help devs debug and understand the system without the need of installing tools/scripts by providing a lot of the tasks as a Slack bot to interact with many daily tedious tasks that are automated via simple commands
